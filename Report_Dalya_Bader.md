## Abstract
The goal of this project is to deal with the factors that will lead to customers satisfaction for an airline and depends on that I explained each column\feature\factor that would be easy for the new customers to see the other's experience for an airline and it will be easy to make a decision. i explained the dataset and i presented these results as charts.



## Design
This project originates from the US Airline needs to deal with factors that will help them to reach the customer satisfaction. the data is provided by US Airline Passenger data. i use this data to analyse and explore the ratings of the services of the airline and Visualize them as charts. i used the results of my analysis to determine which the most factors that have the most effectivness to the others.   

## Data
This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. What factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger? Can you predict passenger satisfaction.
Also, this dataset contains 100k rows and 24 features for each. A few feature highlights include class, gender, type of travel, age, satisfaction, flight distance, customer type and wi-fi service.


## Algorithms
1. replace the wihtespaces in column names by '_' using replace() function  
2. Delete all null values in this column useing dropna() function
3. delete unnessary columns and rows using drop() function 
4. nunique() to know how many values for a specific column 
5. unique() to show what values the column have.


## Tools
There are editors\software and libraries that I uesd for this project. editors\software: GoogleColab, Jupyter, Spyder. libraries: Panadas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, plotly.express.
